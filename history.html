                <p class="history-text">
                    During the Xia Dynasty, frontier nationalities came to the court to perform music 
                    and dance. In the Shang Dynasty, there were local noble children coming from neighboring 
                    regions to study, and the content includes martial arts and music.

                <h3 class="history-heading">Zhou Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    As the Zhou Dynasty replaced the Shang Dynasty and China began to enter feudal society, 
                    music culture was improved unprecedentedly. The court collected and organized the existing 
                    music, established a musical hierarchy based on application, built music institutions, and 
                    conducted musical education. For the first time in China, a system of "Yayue" (雅乐) was 
                    established for rituals and ceremonies. At the same time, the Zhou emperors and the noble 
                    class incorporated foreign music into sacrificial ceremonies and feast performances. This 
                    promoted the inflow of music from surrounding areas.

                <h3 class="history-heading">Qin and Han Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    The Qin and Han Dynasties had frequent contacts with Xiongnu (匈奴) in the north and music 
                    exchanges with the Western regions. For example, in the Han Dynasty, the music of the ethnic 
                    minorities in the northwest was combined with the music of the Han Dynasty to form the trumpeting 
                    music of early China. New instruments such as the Qiang flute (羌笛), the Pipa (琵琶), the Jia 
                    (笳), the Jiao (角), the Konghou (箜篌) were imported. One of the representative works of national 
                    cultural exchange is the Guqin song Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute (胡笳十八拍). In addition, the 
                    Han music bureau recorded "Song of the Harp," (箜篌引) which originated in Korea. Buddhism was 
                    introduced to China from Tianzhu (today's India) around the 1st century AD (Han Dynasty). In the 
                    following centuries, religious believers often incorporated Buddhist content into folk music to 
                    appeal to their followers and propagate their teachings. From the end of the Western Han Dynasty, 
                    the turbulence of history stimulated the ethnic minorities in the northwest to migrate south. As 
                    a result, Xianbei, Xiliang, Qiuzi, and Goryeo music were further integrated with the Han music of 
                    the Central Plains. Instruments including Waist drum (腰鼓), Capricorn drum (羯鼓), Gong, Quxiang 
                    pipa (曲项琵琶), and Five-stringed pipa (五弦琵琶) were introduced into the Central Plains.

                <h3 class="history-heading">Sui and Tang Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    The unification of the Sui and Tang Dynasties and the deepening of the relationship between different 
                    ethnic groups provided favorable conditions for the further integration of music culture. From the fall 
                    of the Eastern Han Dynasty to the establishment of the Sui Dynasty, there were migration of Han people 
                    from the Central Plains to the south; and frequent wars, regime changes, internal migration of ethnic 
                    minorities in the North. The political and social turmoil significantly accelerated the decline of 
                    "elegant music" and the cultural exchanges between the Han nationality and other ethnic groups inside 
                    and outside China, especially in the Western regions, including Xinjiang, Central Asia, West Asia, and 
                    ancient India. A particular category called Yan music refers to the music of palace parties in East Asia. 
                    A large portion of Yan's music, which includes vocal music, instrumental music, dance, and opera, is foreign. 
                    The internationalized Tang Dynasty incorporated various foreign music, such as Indian, Korean, and Middle 
                    Eastern music, into its court music. During that period, there was immigration to the Korean peninsula and 
                    Japan. Influenced deeply by the tributary systems, these countries also sent oversea students and diplomats 
                    to China to bring back advanced music knowledge and other culture.

                <h3 class="history-heading">Yuan, Ming and Qin Dynasty</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, China had extensive musical interaction with the world. During 
                    this period, the Chinese brought their own music to the world and drew inspiration from foreign music. 
                    During the Ming Dynasty, Chinese emperors presented musical instruments of Yayue (雅乐) to the Goryeo and 
                    Joseon Dynasties, indicating that musical exchanges between China and Korea had reached a significant level. 
                    However, "Yayue" was not revived in Joseon for some reason. In addition, ancient Korean folk music also 
                    absorbed elements of ancient Chinese music, and their similarities largely contributed to the fusion and 
                    exchange of musical styles between the two countries. However, Korean folk music also retains its inherent 
                    national characteristics, giving it a unique charm in musical style. Among the many Chinese instruments 
                    introduced to the Ryukyu, the Sanshin (三弦) was given special attention. This instrument was not only widely 
                    used in the Ryukyu Kingdom but was also copied and made by Japanese instrument makers. In addition, the Ryukyu 
                    Kingdom also absorbed the Chinese opera art form and developed a unique form of musical performance called 
                    "kumi odori." (クミヲゥドゥイ) This performance form is based on Sanshin's music, combines elements of poetry, 
                    music, and dance, and has a solid national style and exotic flavor.  In Japan, Kabuki is a comprehensive 
                    variety of art combining foreign and local arts, and it has a long production history, which absorbed the 
                    essence of Chinese song, dance, and drama in its development to form a unique artistic style. In Kabuki, 
                    the performers often use some techniques from opera, such as makeup, costumes, and postures, all of which 
                    reflect the importance of Chinese culture in Kabuki. In conclusion, Chinese music, opera, dance, and other 
                    art forms profoundly influenced Japan's cultural development and promoted the exchange and integration of 
                    the two cultures. In China, Western missionaries introduced Chinese music to Europe and European music to 
                    China. Because of their profound musical attainments, the Western missionaries could play various Western 
                    musical instruments and had an in-depth study and understanding of music theory. The early Qing emperors 
                    Shunzhi (顺治) and Kangxi (康熙) both trusted and valued the learning of the Western missionaries, especially 
                    Kangxi, who made outstanding contribution to the exchange of music and culture. The Kangxi Emperor learned 
                    music theory and other knowledge from many Catholic missionaries. These missionaries introduced European 
                    knowledge of music theory to China in an entire and systematic manner. During the Kangxi period, two books, 
                    "Lv Lv Zuan Yao" (律吕纂要) written by Xu Risheng and "Lv Lv Zheng Yi – Continuation," (律吕正义·续编) became 
                    the earliest formal introduction of European music theory knowledge in Chinese literature. These two books 
                    explained European music's fundamental theories and practical techniques in an in-depth, easy-to-understand 
                    manner. Chinese musical culture interacted with European musical culture through the efforts of the Kangxi 
                    Emperor and the Western missionaries. During the early Qing Dynasty, a large number of European envoys to 
                    China brought pipe organs and clavichords into China as tributes. Over time, these instruments gained 
                    popularity in court and society, becoming a vital part of musical events. At the same time, the French 
                    missionary Joseph-Marie Amiot, who came to China in the latter half of the 18th century, also made significant 
                    contributions to Chinese music. He introduced Chinese music theory systematically to France and Europe and 
                    wrote many articles explaining this knowledge in detail. In particular, he translated the Chinese scholar Li 
                    Guangdi's "Interpretation of Ancient Chinese Music Classics," (古乐经传) which aroused great interest among 
                    the Enlightenment pioneers in Europe at the time and brought more people to the field of Chinese music. 
                    Sheng (笙), a Chinese instrument with a "free spring," was exported to Europe by Amiot. This instrument 
                    gained widespread acceptance and popularity in Europe and quickly led to the invention of three new, more 
                    popular instruments: the harmonica, the accordion, and the reed organ. The invention of these three 
                    instruments brought new elements and techniques to European musical culture.

                <h3 class="history-heading">Before People's Republic of China</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    In the early 20th century, Chinese and Western music cultures slowly merged, driven by the external forces of 
                    art, to create a new style of Chinese music that was based on both cultures. Then, it was not until March 2, 
                    1930, when the "League of Left-Wing Writers" was founded and its corresponding music criticism and music social 
                    activities, that the development of Chinese music entered the next stage. One main change in the early 20th 
                    century happens in music education. In the pre-revolutionary ages, musicians did not have a high social status 
                    and they did not have a formal, standard way of training due to the Confucian ideology. Most of the content was 
                    taught orally and via rote practice. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the introduction of western music theory 
                    and instruments also influenced how traditional music is taught. The National Music Conservatory (the Shanghai 
                    Conservatory of Music today) was founded in 1927, and soon became a role model for other music programs in China. 
                    The conservatory introduced a systematic way of training in Chinese music, including using printed music and 
                    building a universal standard for scoring and tuning. From 1930 to the founding of PRC, music made great progress 
                    under the strong drive of political utilitarian purpose. People call for "national salvation", in the face of this 
                    politics, all social resources should be unreservedly for the service. This notion of music criticism is condensed 
                    in Chairman Mao Zedong's Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, published in May 1942. This work is also 
                    the most important work of music criticism and music practice from the early to long period after the formation of 
                    New China. In the same period, while the politicians were making manifestos, musicians started to write Chinese 
                    music for western music instruments. Take piano for example, in 1934 the Chinese composer He Luting wrote a piece 
                    for piano called "A Shepherd’s Flute," which later became famous internationally. As a student at the National 
                    Music Conservatory, He Luting wrote this piece for a composition competition in Shanghai. A recording of this music 
                    is shared as an external link for readers to get a feeling of this style (see the external link section). An example
                    shows how important the piano, a Western instrument, is for modern Chinese music that during the Cultural Revolution
                    when most Western music instruments were banned, the piano was among the allowed instruments for the so-called "Model 
                    opera" at that time.

                <h3 class="history-heading">After People's Republic of China</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    Chinese musical creations during the founding years of the People's Republic of China, from 1949 to 1976, continue to 
                    serve the political utilitarian purpose, yet have new advancements due to a unified China. Institutional change gave 
                    academic research a rather stable atmosphere, Chinese music was open to the whole society, and the whole society had 
                    access to all kinds of musical sources. During this time, Chinese music started to slowly gain popularity outside. 
                    For instance, New China places a high value on participating in the World Youth Festival, putting together a competent 
                    team to choose the most representative repertoire and creative backbone to do so. China took part in seven World Youth 
                    Festivals consecutively during the course of the 14-year period from the second World Youth Festival in 1949 to the 
                    eighth World Youth Festival in 1962. Each festival's Chinese art Troupe performances feature fresh highlights that 
                    showcase the globe the distinctive charm of New China's music while fervently advancing literature, art, and people's 
                    diplomacy. The invention of the Chinese orchestra is another great advancement. Ensembles are not new in Chinese music 
                    history, as large-scale ensembles are often used in important rituals or at the court. However, the Chinese orchestra 
                    based on the Western orchestra model first appeared in the 20th century, as the Shanghai-based musician Zheng Zhiwen's 
                    attempt to enlarge the size of traditional Jiangnan Sizhu (江南丝竹) ensembles and to compose music for each specific 
                    section. His idea was not popular in his time, but it laid the foundation for the modern Chinese orchestra. Different 
                    from monophonic traditional Chinese music of traditional ensembles, most pieces composed for a modern Chinese orchestra 
                    are polyphonic. More importantly, after the foundation of the PRC, the instruments of the Chinese orchestra were tuned 
                    to be equal-tempered, the same as Western instruments, rather than following the traditional sonic system introduced before.

                <h3 class="history-heading">After Reform and Opening Up</h3>
                <p class="history-text">
                    The next period was marked by the reform and opening up that ushered in a significant turning point for Chinese music. It is 
                    when China and foreigners frequently interacted with each other; it can be called the "new traditional" music period of 
                    China. We can divide the academic music research in China over this time into three stages: Chinese vision, global vision,
                    and global vision under the Chinese vision. A significant point in this period is the meeting "Forum of Young and middle-aged 
                    music Theorists" held in 1986, which was an excellent discussion of liberating the mind and pioneering the Chinese musicology 
                    circle after the reform and opening up. The core topic of the conference is Chinese music theory, researching how to face the 
                    contemporary international new literary trend, and how to apply the academic vision to the global field of music theory research. 
                    Since then, tremendous changes have taken place in the academic vision of musicology research in China, and new methods and 
                    achievements of musicology research in foreign countries have become the focus of the music community. After this, the academic 
                    outlook on musicology research in China has significantly changed, and the music community is now concentrating on cutting-edge 
                    techniques and international musicology research accomplishments. As an example of this time period, in 2000, composer Dun Tan 
                    (谭盾) wrote the famous music piece Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (卧虎藏龙), which mixed traditional Chinese instruments, such 
                    as Erhu (二胡) and Pipa (琵琶), with Western orchestral instruments (see the external link section). At the same time, the boundary 
                    of music research is continually expanding, and it naturally interacts with and exchanges ideas with other social humanities 
                    disciplines, improving the meaning of musicology and raising that subject's status.
